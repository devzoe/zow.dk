      <h3 id="practice--hours">Track how many hours you get of "direct practice"</h3>

      <p>
        According to the Foreign Service Institute, Danish is a Category 1
        language. It takes 575-600 hours of deliberate practice to gain "general
        professional proficiency." It's encouraging that
        <strong
          >to read, speak and write at a high level takes roughly 500
          hours.</strong
        >
        Good to know, right? :)
      </p>
      <p>Personally, I don't always feel that I am making progress. With this rough number of hours as a goal, 
          tracking my progress becomes a little more like a game. I have been tracking deliberate practice for <a href="http://zow.dk/#tallies">2021</a>. 
      </p>

      <p>
        To start having fun with tracking your progress, download the <a href="https://agiletortoise.com/tally/">Tally</a> app
        (iPhone), or
        <a
          href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.daisyapps.ticker&hl=en&gl=US"
          >Counter</a
        >
        app (Android).
      </p>

      <div><img src="img/hour-tracker.jpeg" alt="" /></div>

      <h4>As deliberate practice, I count hours spent on things like:</h4>
      <p>-Group activities with svigerfamilien</p>
      <p>
        -Danish class (including speaking Danish during
        breaks)
      </p>
      <p>
        -Any Danish programs or films that need active listenting and reading
        Danish subtitles
      </p>
      <p>-Time spent completing homework assignments</p>
      <p>-Free grammar exercises on the wonderful <a href="http://basby.dk/modul1/index.htm">basby.dk</a></p>

      <p>-Networking or socializing with classmates in Danish outside of class</p>

    

      <h3 id="practice--tests">Practice tests</h3>
      
      <p>I did (2) timed practice tests in the week leading up to the exam.</p>
      <p>
        You can find practice tests at
        <a href="https://modultest.gyldendal.dk/">modultest.dk</a>.
      </p>
      <div><img src="img/module-practice-test.png" alt="" /></div>

      <p>Use the practice tests to learn the format of the test. Use the scoring as feedback to see which areas need more work. 
        Develop strategies that will improve your performance and try to implement them, or keep reading. 
    </p>
      <p>
        If my first practice test had been real, I would not have passed. There were too
        many errors in the Reading section, and I did not complete the Written
        exercise in time.
      </p>

      <p>For more practice with the Written exam, check out the <a href="https://www.learn-danish.com/prove-i-dansk-3-preparation-written-exam/">Learn Danish</a> blog which has free, downloadable resources.</p>
  
      <h3 id="about--test">About the test</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>
            There are (4) sections and (11) exercises total. The entire exam
          takes roughly 3 hours.</strong
        >
      </p>
      <p>Lytning (3 exercises, 5 min each)</p>
      <p>Læsning (4 exercises, 55 minutes total)</p>
      <p>Skrivning (2 exercises, 45 minutes each)</p>

      <p>og Mundtlig (2 exercises, 5 minutes each)</p>

      <h3 id="lytning--takeaways">Lytning Takeaways & Resources</h3>

      <p>
        <strong>Lytning</strong> was my strongest area. This was not a surprise.
        Most of my listening practice happens while I'm doing activites with svigerfamilien on
        weekends. I try to follow the conversations, ask when I don't
        understand, and join in where I can. På dansk!
      </p>

      <h4>To watch</h4>

      <p>
        Another way I practice listening is by watching episodes of <a href="https://www.netflix.com/dk-en/title/70285368">Rita (2012)</a> or <a href="https://www.dr.dk/drtv/serie/borgen_249509">Borgen (2010)</a>
        with Danish subtitles. Watch once to enjoy it, twice to understand it, a
        third time to learn "faste udtryk" and new expressions.</p> 

        <a href="https://www.netflix.com/dk-en/title/70285368"><img src="img/rita-poster.png" alt=""/></a>
        
        <p>The trick is not to get bored with something that is familiar, 
        but to keep looking for something new or refine what you "know". It seems obvious, but 
        try to always <em>build on what you know</em>.
      </p>

      <a href="https://www.dr.dk/drtv/serie/borgen_249509"><img src="img/borgen-poster.png" alt=""/></a>

      <p>Here is a quick list of entertaining Danish films to practice with:

              <li>Druk (2020, dir. Thomas Vinterberg)</li>
              <li>Adams Æbler (2005, dir. Anders Thomas Jensen)</li>
              <li>Madklubben (2020, dir. Barbara Topsøe-Rothenborg)</li>

      </div>
      <p>
        Listen to <a href="https://www.zetland.dk/">Zetland</a> articles of interest. Read along with the original text
        as the author narrates their article in the app. It's nice that you can pause and rewind the audio while reading along.
        (I wish there was a feature change the playback speed.) Overall, this is a great tool to expand vocabulary and learn about relevant subjects beyond Danish textbooks.

        <a href="https://podtail.com/en/podcast/fries-before-guys/"><div><img src="img/fries-before-guys-podcast.png" alt=""/></div></a>   

        <p> Take an episode of the <a href="https://podtail.com/en/podcast/fries-before-guys/">Fries Before Guys</a> podcast for a walk. I find this material challenging, and that it can be a
            good space to learn current slang and faste udtryk. 
      </p>

          Alternatively, here are some charming/ funny Danish songs I dare you to learn:

      <h3 id="lytning--tips">Lytning Test Tips</h3>

      <h4>Tip# 1: If you can't spell it, don't</h4>
      <p>
        The mistakes I made with the "kortsvar" were the answers that requried
        me to write down numbers. I spelled "millioner" and "billiarder" wrong.
        My work-around strategy if you're not certain how to spell a number is
        to <strong>write the numbers numerically instead.</strong>
      </p>
      <p>
        According to the practice test, "50.000.000" works as well as "halvtreds
        millioner". And I wouldn't have seen the list of acceptable answers if I
        had not done the practice test.
      </p>
      <p><em>(The answer key lists all possible answers.) </em></p>

      <h4>Tip #2: Only answer what is being asked</h4>

      <p>
        <strong>Only answer the question that are being asked.</strong> For
        example. One real test question asked,
      </p>
      <p>
        <em
          >What was stolen from the local business you've just heard about?"</em
        >
        And I could remember hearing the answer was "x million cigarettes".
      </p>
      <p>
        In the last minute of the test, I changed my answer to "cigarettes" to
        avoid misspeling the precise number. This was an acceptable answer
        because all the test asked was "What" was stolen, not "<em>How many</em>
        of what".
        <strong
          >Avoid answering more than the test requires in the kortsvar
          sections.</strong
        >
      </p>

      <h3 id="læsning--takeaways">Læsning Takeaways & Tips</h3>
      <p>
        <strong>Læsning</strong> had the most mistakes. General takeaways were:
      </p>
      <ul>
        <li>Try and read carefully</li>
        <li>Use any extra time to look over your answers again</li>
        <li>Avoid waffling on an answer!</li>
      </ul>
      <p>
        The answers I changed last minute because I second-guessed ended up being
        wrong. The original answer turned out to be correct. This happened more than once. 
      </p>

      <p>
        From the practice tests, it was clear that I was using most of the time
        to do the exercises. There was almost no time left over to go back and
        check my work.
      </p>

      <h3 id="læsning--strategies">Læsning Test Strategies</h3>

      <p><strong>1) Skim through the material first </strong></p>
      <p>
        Get familiar with how many pages are in the text you are reading from.
        Skim the questions to see what you are being asked.
      </p>

      <p>One one practice test, I struggled to find an answer because I didn't realize there was a 
        third page of material to comb through. 
        Avoid this by scanning all of the material visually to make sure you're not missing anything. 
      </p>

      <p><strong>2) Mark up the page with a pencil</strong></p>
      <p>
        Circle or underline the answers as you find them in the text. Write the
        answers on scratch paper as you go. That way, when you fill in the
        formal answer sheet, you are also double-checking your work.
      </p>

      <p><strong>3) Work quickly</strong></p>
      <p>
        Focus on answering the question and finding the answer in the text. Skim
        the text for key words to answer the question.
      </p>
      <p>Skip a question you're not sure about, then come back to it later.</p>

      <p><strong>4) Don't try to understand everything in the text</strong></p>
      <p>
        That's not what this is about. We are being tested on how efficiently we
        can find the right answer. Not how well we understand the complete text.
      </p>

      <p><strong>5) Ask why is this the best answer</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the section with missing sentences, read the sentences that come
        before and after the gap. Write the 1 or 2 closest answers that fit in
        the gap with you pencil and keep moving.
      </p>
      <p>
        At the end, if you have used an answer twice, have a small argument for
        why one answer works better than the other.
      </p>

      <p><strong>6) Start reading from the bottom up</strong></p>
      <p>
        In the section where you have to match a paragraph to a person, start by
        reading the last paragraph. Work your way up to the first in reverse
        order.
      </p>
      <p>Skim and keep an eye out for any opinion expressed in each paragraph. Mark with your pencil any line where the person says "tror/synes".</p>
      <p>Or where they express any positive or negative opinions. When you find the clear opinion, do a quick check to see if it is a match for any of the choices and keep moving. </p>

      <h3 id="skrivning--takeaways">Skrivning Takeaways</h3>

      <p>I bombed this section in the practice test because I spent too much time looking up words in my "ordbog". I had gotten used to using online tools like <a href="https://translate.google.com/">Google Translate</a> and <a href="https://ordnet.dk/ddo">Ordnet.dk</a> to look words up quickly.</p>
      <p>And I underestimated the difference between writing by hand versus on a computer. </p>

      <h3 id="skrivning--tips">Skrivning Test Tips</h3>
      <h4>Tip #1 : Practice writing by hand (timed) :</h4>

      <p>While I had been good about doing written homework assignments, I never <strong>set a time limit</strong>. Having to write coherently, by hand and under time pressure made me panic. </p>

      <h4> Tip # 2 : Have a plan for your writing :</h4>

      <p>
          <ul>
              <li>
                Bring your own scratch paper
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Choose the prompt that is most interesting to you, and
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                read through the prompt 3 times
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>
                Jot down broad ideas and <strong>build a "mind map"</strong> to structure what you want to write about
              </li>
              <br>
              <li>Start writing only when you <strong>have a clear idea of where you want to go</strong></li>
          </ul>
      </p>

      <h4>Tip #3 : Keep it simple</h4>

      <p>Rather than using time to search for words you don't know off hand, try to use what you know. 
        <strong>It sounds funny, but lower your ambitions.</strong></p>
        <p> The more you can use what you know, the more time you will save. </p>

        <h4>Tip #4 : Ask about using a verb list </h4>

        <p>Ask your teacher or moderator if you can use a <a>500-verbs list</a> during the written test. 
            Use it with your dictionary (which you should also try to bring yourself.)</p>

    <h3 id="mundtlig--tips">Mundtlig Test Tips:</h3>        

    <h4>(presentation / oplæg)</h4>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Prepare a short presentation. Write it out, practice it aloud, and aim for 1-2 minutes.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Use only words you are familiar with and know how to pronounce.</strong>
        </li>
        <li>
            Limit the number of new words you bring into the presentation. 
            <strong>Try to trust and use what you know.</strong>
        </li>
    </ul>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Choose a clear/ specific subject and state it before you start.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Speak generally about the subject.</strong> Compare something you have learned about in Denmark with
            how it works in your country. Give your personal view, but try to open it up to something more
            general and not only subjective. 
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Bonus points if you can back up your view with any statistics.</strong> 
            (This is where a notecard with key words comes in handy.)
        </li>

    <ul>
        <li>
            Write key words on a notecard (I prepared this and didn't end up using it in the exam)
        </li>
        <li>
            Practice speaking to the others in the room: Speak slowly and clearly.

        <li> 
            <strong>Don't get discouraged if you get asked to repeat something.</strong>
            It shows the others' engagement and that they want to get what you are saying!

    <ul>
        <li>
            Take notes on what others are saying in their presentations
        </li>
        <li>
            Get ready to <strong>ask questions about whar you hear.</strong> 
            Try to use open-ended "Hv" (Hvorfor, hvordan..) questions rather than Ja/ Nej questions.
        </li>
        <li>
            <strong>Ask if you don't understand</strong> what the other person is saying.
