      <ul>
        <li><b>1971</b> - Born with identical twin <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Rane_Willerslev" id="tribute-link" target=_blank>Rane Willerslev</a> in <a href="https://www.tripadvisor.com/Attractions-g2551037-Activities-Gentofte_Municipality_Copenhagen_Region_Zealand.html" target=_blank>Gentofte</a> to historian Richard Willerslev. Their father raised them to be “tough” in the face of adversity. From the age of 6 their father teaches them to cut firewood and climb trees, to make bullets from boulders, to swim in ice water, and other skills.</li>
        <li><b>1984-87</b> - Spends the summers backpacking, wandering, and taking canoe trips to Lapland in northern Sweden and Finland with brother Rane.
</li>
        <li><b>1987</b> - Starts high school at Ordrup Gymnasium. Is challenged by a German language teacher, who suggests Eske move down to a less advanced level.
This inspires Eske’s “fighting spirit” and he develops an interest in learning and academic achievement. He excels in his studies and earns top grades in “all subjects except for French”, according to Eske.</li>
        <li><b>1990</b> - Graduates from high school. With no dreams of studying further, Eske with brother Rane uses childhood savings to help finance their first expedition to Siberia. The dream of “following in the footsteps'' of previous researchers is realized. For 2.5 months they collect ethnographic material and remains from ice age animals. They donate their findings to the <a href="https://www.moesgaardmuseum.dk/en/" target=_blank>Moesgaard Museum</a> in Aarhus. </li>
        <li><b>1993-94</b> -  Lives as a fur hunter in the <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Sakha" target=_blank>Sakha (Yakutia) Republic</a> with local hunters. Temperatures indoors are -20 C. At one low point, where there is no petroleum for lamps, no food from successful hunts, and no more tea, Christmas evening is spent in total darkness drinking boiled water.
</li>
        <li><b>1994</b> - Returns home to Denmark, where he learns his sister has passed away, his father is beginning to suffer from dementia, and his girlfriend of 3 years has moved on. Eske enrolls to study biology at Copenhagen University and finds happiness researching environmental DNA from plants, mammals and birds.
</li>
        <li><b>1998</b> - Graduates from Copenhagen University with a MSc. from the Department of Zoology.
</li>
        <li><b>2004</b> - Completes thesis on the “Recovery and analysis of ancient DNA from ice, sediments and fossil remains”. Receives DSc. in Ancient DNA from the Department of Biology at the University of Copenhagen. Becomes the youngest Full Professor at the University of Copenhagen.</li>
